# run-jetty-run-fork

This is a fork of the original RJR from google code site. Since the original RJR has been out of maintaince, I am going to handle it over and release a new version to add jetty9 support.

## Versions:

- 1.3.3

    The final official release from the original RJR.

- 1.3.4

    This release constains all the unreleased fixes from the original RJR, without any new fixes(with support of jetty 9.0.0M3).

- 1.3.5

    Added Jetty 9.3 support for Java8 developers. Released as nightly(CDI support is disabled for some startup issues).


All the update site links of above versions can be found at [update links](http://xzer.github.io/run-jetty-run/).
