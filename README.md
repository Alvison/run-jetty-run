# run-jetty-run-fork

This is a fork of the original RJR from google code site. Since the original RJR has been out of maintaince, I am going to handle it over and release a new version to add jetty9 support(it seems that most works has been done and just need release it).

Be considering to release it by a new name as "run-jetty-run-fork".
